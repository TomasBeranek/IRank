This experiment demonstrates that Infer consistently identifies the entry point
function (the highest stored function in the Call Graph related to the error)
in the 'procedure' attribute in the output report.json.

All scenarios contain the 'main' function, which calls the 'f' function. There
are three possible combinations of error occurrence and manifestation:

    scenario1.c - the error starts in 'main' and manifests in 'f'.
    scenario2.c - the error starts in 'f' and manifests in 'main'.
    scenario3.c - the error starts and manifests in 'main', but 'f' has
                  influence on the error manifestation.

The files report1.json, report2.json, and report3.json show the outputs from Infer.
