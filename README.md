### Specification

  1. Learn about the Infer tool for static analysis and finding bugs in software.
  2. Explore the possibilities of using machine learning in the context of source code analysis.
  3. Get a dataset containing the bugs found by Infer, with information on whether they are real bugs or not.
  4. Design and implement a machine learning based approach (using the dataset obtained in Section 3) that will be able to automatically determine whether a bug found by Infer represents a real bug or not.
  5. Evaluate the quality of your solution on at least two different open-source projects.
  6. Summarize and discuss the results obtained and their possible extensions.
