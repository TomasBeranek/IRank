Behave like a binary classification model. You will receive a sample from the D2A dataset, containing reports from Meta Infer static analyzer. Your goal is to output a number in the range <0,1>. The higher the number, the more certain you are that the report from Infer is true. Individual samples contain the report itself, the location of the error, codes of functions related to the error, and other useful information.
